<h2> What is the shell and how do I access the shell?</h2>
<p>
The shell is a program that presents a command line interface which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination. <br/>

A terminal is a program you run that gives you access to the shell. There are many different terminal programs that vary across operating systems.
<br/>
To open a terminal (on Linux), just single click on the "Terminal" icon on the Desktop. If you don't know how to start the terminal program on your platform please ask for help.

<h3> The Example: Manipulating Experimental Data Files</h3>
<p> We will spend most of our time learning about the basics of the shell by manipulating some experimental data from a hearing test. To get the data for this test, you will need internet access and an open terminal. Just enter the command:</p>
<pre> git clone https://github.com/apawlik/2014-01-14-manchester.git</pre>
<p>
The git command will grab all of the data needed for this workshop from GitHub.<br/>
Followed by: </p>
<pre>cd 2014-01-14-manchester </pre>
 
<h2>Let's get started </h2>
<p>One very basic command is echo. This command just prints text to the terminal. Try the command: </p>
<pre>echo Hello, World </pre>
<p> Then press enter. You should see the text "Hello, World" printed back to you. The echo command is useful for printing from a shell script, for displaying variables, and for generating known values to pass to other programs.</p>

<h3>Moving around the file system </h3>
<p>Let's learn how to move around the file system using command line programs. This is really easy to do using a GUI (just click on things). Once you learn the basic commands, you'll see that it is really easy to do in the shell too.
<br/> <br/>
First we have to know where we are. The program pwd (print working directory) tells you where you are sitting in the directory tree. The command ls will list the files in the current directory. Directories are often called "folders" because of how they are represented in GUIs. Directories are just listings of files. They can contain other files or directories.
<br/> <br/>
Whenever you start up a terminal, you will start in a special directory called the home directory. Every user has their own home directory where they have full access to do whatever they want. In this case, the pwd command tells us that the name of our home directory is. The last word in that listing should also be the name of your user. You can also find out your user name by entering the command whoami.
